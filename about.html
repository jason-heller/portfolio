                I am a college graduate of Binghamton University with a bachelors degree in Actuarial Science. I have a general interest in mathematics, and I am self taught in the field of computer science. I am currently studying for the Actuarial FM exam, which I project to finish by August of 2021.

                I have been interested in software and game development since the mid to late 2000s. Since that time, I have both written and assisted with projects of varying types and scopes. Originally, I would program video games using an application called Game Maker, using GML primarily, the application's propriatary scripting language. Since then, I have branched out to other languages such as Java, Javascript, GLSL, HLSL, etc. depending on what best suits my current endeavour. I primarily work with Java, and have written a few applications in it, as well as some games and even a fully-3D game engine.
