                    The moonglade engine is a 3D game engine written using Java and openGL. Originally written to support procedurally generated infinite worlds, the engine was split into two branches, with the former fufilling it's original goal of supporting procedural games, while the latter branch was modified to support games with more static environments. This branch, the one on which 'project moonglade' is built on, supports procedurally-infinite worlds, which can be interacted with and modified, a day/night cycle, dynamic lighting/shadows, and procedural biomes generated via distorted deterministic voronoi diagrams. In addition, the engine contains a tile-based building system, which allows for walls, floors, and slopes that can have unique meshes and textures. The engine also has a built-in debugging console that utilizes Java's reflection for easy and quick debugging.

                <p>
                    This project is a branch of the game engine I used for my previous project, heavily modified to support static environments rather than procedurally generated ones. The main differences in this project are the use of BSP-trees to render pre-built environments, complete with baked lightmaps, ambient lighting, precomputed node graphs, and A-star pathfinding for entities. The engine also features a rudimentary physics system, which, while existent in the original engine, was further expanded upon in this branch. In it's current state, this game supports three maps.

                    Collaborating with the <a href="http://coco.binghamton.edu/netscidraw/">NetSciDraw</a> team at Binghamton University, I successfully implemented shape-recognition, a resizeable canvas with click and drag support. I also help fixed bugs related to cross-platform compatibility. NetSciDraw is a cross-platform application written using node.js, meant to be used as a teaching supplement for explaining information systems with a simple and intuitive interface. I acted as the lead developer during my time on the team.
